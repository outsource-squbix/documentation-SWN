:::caution
1.Once you establish a connection between a public did & pairwise server,there is no need to connect again.if you uninstall & install  
the app or update the app or log out,then it will be automatically disconnected & you have to establish the connection again.  
2.Pairwise login is impossible without establishing a connectin between a public did & pairwise server.
